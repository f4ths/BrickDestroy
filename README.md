# BrickDestroy

Software Maintenance COMP2042

These are the changes that have been made to the original code:

- Renamed package to `com.BrickDestroy` in order to aid in restructuring into maven file naming convention.
    - The source package was originally called test. This made differentiating between the source code and the test files difficult. <br />
    
    
- Basic code maintenance have been done. This includes:
    - Achieving encapsulation by creating setters and getters for private variables.
    - De-cluttering large methods by extracting parts of methods into smaller ones.
